    <Pre> PROJECT DESCRIPTION

        Using domain in
                                        <b><i>BIG DATA</i></b>

        In the field of big data applications, image information is widely used. The value density of
        information utilization in big data is very low, and how to extract useful information quickly
        is very important. So we should transform the unstructured image data source into a form that 
        can be analysed.In this paper, we proposed a fast image retrieval method which designed for big 
        data. First of all, the feature extraction method is necessary and the feature vectors can be 
        obtained for every image. 


        It is the most important step for us to encode the image feature vectors and make them into 
        database, which can optimize the feature structure. Finally, the corresponding similarity matching
        is used to determine the retrieval results.
        
        There are three main contributions for image retrieval in this paper. New feature extraction method,
        reasonable  elements ranking and appropriate distance metric can improve the algorithm performance. 

        Experiments show that our method has a great improvement in the effective performance of feature 
        extraction and can also get better search matching results.
